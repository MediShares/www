          <p>MDS is a digital Token used, besides other scenarios, on MediShares platform. MDS is not an investment target and we cannot guarantee the value addition of MDS, whose value may decrease under certain conditions. Due to unpredictable factors, targets listed in this White Paper may change. While our team will make its best efforts to realize all targets stated in this White Paper, all individuals and groups purchasing MDS shall shoulder the risks on their own.</p>
          <p>MDS does not represent a right of ownership or control. Controlling MDS does not mean ownership of MediShares or MediShares applications. MDS does not confer any right on any individual to exercise participation in, control over or decision- making on MediShares and MediShares applications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subtitle">8.2  Risk Warning</div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>As a new model of investment, investment in digital asset involves various risks. Potential investors shall discreetly assess the investment risks and their own risk tolerance.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Risks on Token Sales Market</p>
              <p>The environment of Token sales market is closely associated with the situation of the whole digital currency market. In case of sluggish overall market situation or existence of other uncontrollable factors, the price of Token may be underestimated over a long period of time, in spite of their own good prospect.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Supervision Risks</p>
              <p>Since Blockchain is still in the early stage of development, there are still no laws and regulation across the world, including in China, that stipulate requirements for precondition, transaction, information disclosure, and locking, etc. in the process of ICO. Also it’s still unclear as to how the current policies will be implemented. All these factors may bring uncertainty to project investment and liquidity. Blockchain technology has become the main target of supervision in major countries of the world. If there is any intervention or exertion of influence by supervising authorities, MediShares application or MDS may be affected. For example, if there is legal limitation on the use and sale of Token, MDS may suffer restriction and obstruction, or the development of MediShares application and MDS may be directly terminated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Competition Risks</p>
              <p>With advancement of information technology and mobile Internet, digital assets with “Bitcoin” as a representative are gradually prospering and various decentralized applications are continuously emerging, heating up industrial competition. With the steady appearance and expansion of other application platforms, the community will face constant operation pressure and certain risks from market competition.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Talent Loss</p>
              <p>MediShares has gathered a technical team and expert consultants with leading advantage and profound experiences in their respective professional sectors, including professionals with lasting engagement in the Blockchain industry and core team with rich experience in development and operation of Internet product. The core competitiveness of MediShares in the industry lies in its stable core team and consultant resources, the loss of which may affect stable platform operation or its future development.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Development Failure Due to Fund Shortage</p>
              <p>In case of dropping price of Token raised by the founding team or prolonged development time, the team may face a shortage of development fund and possibly even suffer subsequent serious shortage of fund for all activities. In such case, there will be a risk that the intended targets will not be realized.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Private Key Loss</p>
              <p>After the digital wallet address of MDS is extracted by the buyer, the only means to operate content contained in the address is by his/her associated secret key (private key or wallet passcode). Users are personally responsible for protecting the associated secret keys which will be used to sign transactions and prove their asset ownership. Users understand and accept that if his/her private key document or passcode are respectively lost or stolen, his/her MDS associated with his/her user account (address) or passcode will be unrecoverable and permanently lost. The best method for secure storage of log-in document is to store the secret key separately at one or several places and avoid using a shared computer for this purpose.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Hacking or Theft</p>
              <p>There is a possibility that hackers, other entities or nations may attempt to interrupt MediShares application or MDS function with any methods, including but not limited to DoS attack, Sybil attack, guerrilla-style attack, malware attack and homogeneity attack, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Absence of Loss Insurance</p>
              <p>Unlike bank account or accounts with other financial institutions, MediShares account or related Blockchain network are generally without any insurance guarantee. For losses under any conditions, no public individual or public entity will provide insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risks of Core Protocols</p>
              <p>Currently MediShares platform is developed on the basis of Ethereum. In case of any defect, unexpected malfunction or attack to Ethereum, MDS or MediShares platform may suffer a stop or loss of function in a manner hard to expect.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>System Risk</p>
              <p>There are risks related to neglected critical defects in open source software or large-scale failure of global network infrastructure. Though some of the risks may drop over time due to bug fixes and breakthroughs in computation bottleneck, other risks are still unpredictable, such as political factors or natural disasters that may interrupt part of the Internet or the global Internet as a whole.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risks Due to Bugs or Cryptography Development</p>
              <p>Rapid cryptography development and advancement of science and technology such as quantum computer may bring the risk of cracking to MediShares platform, leading to possible MDS loss.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risks of Insufficient Attention</p>
              <p>There is a possibility that MediShares application may fail to be used by a large number of individuals or entities. This means that the public do not have enough interest in developing and improving the relevant distributed applications. Such lack of interest may bring negative impact to MDS and MediShares application.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Poor Acceptance or User Shortage</p>
              <p>First of all MDS shall not be deemed as an investment target. Even if MDS may have some value after some time, such value can be very small if MediShares is not accepted by the market and is therefore short of users. There is a possibility that due to any possible reasons, including but not limited to failure in business relations or marketing strategy, MediShares platform and all the future marketing efforts supported with the raised fund may fail to achieve success. In such case, there will be few or no follow-up supporters for the platform. Of course, this will be very unfavorable to this project.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Application Defect</p>
              <p>MediShares platform may fail to provide normal service due to defects caused by known or unknown reasons (e.g. large-scale Node crash), and may even suffer loss of user MDS in a serious situation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Risk of Application or Product Failing to Reach Their Expectation or Buyer’s Expectation</p>
              <p>MediShares application is still under development stage, and major changes may be made before the launch of official version. The expectation or imagination by MDS itself or by buyers for the function or manner (including behaviors of participants) of MediShares application or MDS may not be satisfied. Such situation may be caused by any analysis mistake or change of a single design, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Other Unpredictable Risks</p>
              <p>Token which is based on cryptography is a fully new technology that has not be tested. In addition to risks already described in this White Paper, there are other risks that are not yet mentioned or not anticipated by the founding team. Also, other risks may come suddenly, or several risks mentioned above may occur in combination.</p>
